# cifar10
This repository contains work done on the cifar10 dataset.
You will find several items as part of this repository:
1) multi_cifar10.py  contains the main program of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) build
2) multi_cifar10_score.py  is some simple work on how to call the model to get the accuracy and loss of the model.
3) multipredict.py  is a borrowed cifar 10 prediction program. It's so cool, I had to repost it here.
4) multimodelwork.pdf  is just my initial 3 models/progress on trying to optimize the learning of the network.
